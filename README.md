# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor: MODULE 1 Challenge

## Description

HTML and CSS code for the Horiseon website has been cleaned up and uploaded to this repository, which will be linked below. The source code has been adjusted to include semantic HTML elements, simplification of source code, alt text for images, and a new title. With the new and clean CSS and HTML, the website look and feel has remained consistent as shown in the screenshot below.
